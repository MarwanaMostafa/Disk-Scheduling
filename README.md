# Disk-Scheduling

schedule disk through several algorithms like  : FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK , C-LOOK and  the newly optimized algorithm

## How TO Run :
i have two mehtod to run command line and GUI 
 
 1-Command Line : 
 
    i-javac namefile.java
    
    ii-java namefile.java input
  
  2-Gui :
   
    i need  only from you enter input 

## Input For Program to Run :
  1-disk queue with requests for I/O blocks on cylinders like : 98, 183, 37, 122, 14, 124, 65, 67
  
  2-initial head start cylinder
  
  3-Algorithm which do you need using for scheduling
  
##  Output :
    1-the total head movement per algorithm.
    
    2-The output result should show the sequence of head movement to access the  requested cylinders based on the implemented algorithms.



## Example : 
    * Disk queue : 98, 183, 37, 122, 14, 124, 65, 67

    * Initial head :53 
    
    * Algorithm :SCAN

## Output :
